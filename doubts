That is a beautiful and profound quote by Rumi. It offers a powerful perspective on dealing with change, uncertainty, and personal transformation.
Here is a lucid explanation of its deeper meaning and interpretations.
🧘 Embracing Change, Not Resisting It
The opening lines, "Try not to resist the changes that come your way. Instead let life live through you," advocate for a fundamental shift in attitude toward life's inevitable flux.
 * Non-Resistance: Resistance is a source of suffering. When we fight against a difficult situation or transition, we expend energy and cause ourselves mental anguish. Rumi suggests that fighting change is futile, like struggling against a strong river current.
 * Surrender to Life's Flow: The phrase "let life live through you" is the key. It's an invitation to surrender not out of defeat, but out of trust in the process of life itself. It means dropping the need for total control and instead becoming a willing vessel or conduit for whatever experience life brings—good or bad. This aligns with the Sufi concept of tawakkul (reliance on God or the universe).
🔄 The Upside-Down Transformation
The quote continues with the powerful and comforting thought, "And do not worry that your life is turning upside down."
 * The Metaphor of Inversion: A life "turning upside down" is our common description for crisis, chaos, or massive disruption—losing a job, ending a relationship, moving, or a spiritual awakening. It implies that everything familiar and stable is being upended.
 * The Necessity of Disruption: Rumi subtly suggests that this disruption is often necessary for growth. For a new structure to be built, the old one must sometimes be completely demolished. The universe, or your deeper self, might be orchestrating this inversion to clear the way for something better. 
💡 Challenging the Status Quo
The final, most profound lines pose a rhetorical question: "How do you know that the side you are used to is better than the one to come?"
 * Questioning Comfort: This directly challenges our attachment to our comfort zone and the status quo. We fear change because we are familiar with our current "side," even if it is flawed, limiting, or unhappy. We equate familiarity with goodness.
 * The Unveiling of Potential: Rumi reminds us that we are limited in our vision. We can only see the present side. The "side to come" is the side of potential, growth, and undiscovered happiness. The seemingly chaotic "upside-down" state may be the very position required to reveal a richer, more authentic, or more expansive way of living that we couldn't have imagined from our old perspective.
🔑 Summary of Interpretation
The quote is essentially a spiritual and psychological prescription:
> Stop fighting the chaos; accept it as the necessary process for transformation. What feels like a fall might actually be the start of a new, better orientation that your limited perspective couldn't have engineered on its own.
