My apologies for the confusion. When you provided the new "Experience Summary" and "Skills Summary" points, I used those as the source material for that version, as they were different from your notes.
I understand now. You want me to take your original, detailed DevOps notes and structure that information into the "Experience Summary" / "Skills Summary" format you provided.
Here is that new version, built only from your original training notes.
