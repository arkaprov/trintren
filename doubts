Dusk - fav time of the day, that's why nov is the fav month... enjoy the absurdity of life

i am the cosmic dread lover.

i will dream even if life betrays me, and i will dream even if dreams abandon me..

i dream too much, work too little..

i believe modern luxury is the ability to think clearly, sleep deeply, move slowly, and love quietly in a world designed to prevent all four.

now i have to make a 7 pages ppt about myself, above are about myself. make me 7 pages creative yet lucid ppt.
